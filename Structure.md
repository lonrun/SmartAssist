## Backend Development Language

Go is a great choice for the backend development language as it is fast, efficient, and has a strong standard library. It also has great support for concurrency, which can be useful for handling multiple requests at once. Additionally, Go has a growing community and many useful third-party packages that can help with development.

This structure includes a `public` folder for static assets such as the HTML file and favicon, a `src` folder for the main source code, and subfolders for components, services, and styles. 

The `components` folder contains React components for each feature, such as `PDFReader` for reading PDFs and `TicketBooking` for booking tickets. 

The `services` folder contains modules for interacting with the backend API, such as `pdfService` for sending requests to the PDF reading endpoint and `ticketService` for booking tickets. 

The `styles` folder contains CSS files for styling the app.
